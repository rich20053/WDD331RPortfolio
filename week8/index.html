                    For example, say your developers have come up with the perfect amortization 
                    program and you want to install it on the workgroup server for other systems 
                    to remotely mount and use. Because this is a third-party or custom application, 
                    the logical place for it is in /usr/local/appname, possibly with a link to the 
                    program binary in the /usr/local/bin directory (because that's in the path).
                  </p>

                        If given a choice between putting the software package bigprog in the 
                        /usr/local/bigprog section and the /opt/bigprog section, it's hard to 
                        choose. Read any relevant exam question closely--the main difference 
                        being that the /opt section is not considered to be sharable, whereas 
                        the /usr section is often shared and mounted by client systems.

                  <p>A major section of the 101 exam is dedicated to how to run commands properly 
                      with the right options and arguments. As a good sysadmin, you'll be expected 
                      to know how to create, delete, edit, set permissions on, display, move, copy, 
                      and determine the type of files and programs.

                        You must be able to pick proper and working commands out of lists of 
                        possibilities, type in appropriate strings in fill-in-the-blank boxes, 
                        and in general show that you've run the programs and utilities in 
                        question.

                        Because most users and sysadmins come from a Windows or other OS background, 
                        a quick set of recommendations for the less-experienced can be of help here:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="tip-list">
                        <li>► <strong>Hidden files aren't really hidden</strong> - They just begin with a ., 
                            such as the .bashrc and .bash_profile files. These are not viewable 
                            by normal users with conventional commands and switches and aren't 
                            deleted by commands such as rm -f *.*.
                        </li>
                        <li>► <strong>Filenames can contain multiple periods or no period characters</strong> - 
                            The filenames this.is.a.long.file and thisisalongfile are perfectly 
                            reasonable and possible.
                        </li>
                        <li>► <strong>Spaces in filenames look nice, but are a pain to type</strong> - Use an _ 
                            or a - instead of spaces because it's neater and easier than prefixing 
                            all spaces with a \. (To display a space in a filename, the system 
                            shows a space prefixes with a backslash.)</li>
